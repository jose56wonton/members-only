# Members-Only
Members-Only is a miniture project for Rails practice. It is basically just a message board that allows only logged in users to view who wrote the messages.

The project is deployed as of June 2017. Check it out [here](https://members-only-jw.herokuapp.com/). Feel free to login with 
'username@gmail.com' and 'password' to test out the functionality. Please keep it PG though :)
